# Polyrythms? 
https://laurenanastasia.github.io/Polyrhythms-/
basically I would like to do a to do a 3/4 polyrythm with 2 balls 

I think this will have something to do with the speeds in proportion to one aother, but I can't quite work out the math right now

Ideally I would have one ball1 bouncing at one speed, up and down like its effected by gravity, and ball2 doing the same but a different speed so that I get a 3/4

This animation is probably above the scope of this project, but its just what im thinking about looking ahead
